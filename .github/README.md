# AM2R 3DS (developer README)

> [!NOTE]
> Players: downloads and the install guide are on Codeberg, [codeberg.org/NattensMadrigal/AM2R_3DS](https://codeberg.org/NattensMadrigal/AM2R_3DS). This page is for building and working on the port.

AM2R (Another Metroid 2 Remake) on the New Nintendo 3DS: the 1.5.5 Community Updates (recommended) or the original 1.1.

This is a game-specific fork of [Butterscotch](https://github.com/ButterscotchRunner/Butterscotch), an open source
re-implementation of the GameMaker: Studio runner in C. Butterscotch runs the game's own bytecode (`data.win`), so the
3DS build runs AM2R's real game code; this repository adds the 3DS platform layer and the changes AM2R needs on it. The
3DS rendering, audio and preprocessing code started from
[Cinnamon](https://github.com/Project-Sunshine-Native/cinnamon)'s Undertale 3DS port.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need your own copy of AM2R. This repository does not include any game files.

## Which version

- **AM2R 1.5.5 (Community Updates)**, made from your AM2R 1.1 with the
  [AM2R Launcher](https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2RLauncher): the version this port is tuned for. Its
  own 16:9 widescreen picture (426x240) suits the 400x240 top screen, and the "Fast scripts" option (built-in versions of
  its busiest scripts) only applies to it.
- **AM2R 1.1**: still runs (4:3, stretched or 1:1).

Saves don't carry over between the two: 1.5 saves as `save1`..`save3`, 1.1 as `sav1`..`sav3`.

## Install

1. **SD card files.** Download `am2r-sd.bat` (Windows) or `am2r-sd.sh` (Linux) from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/pegacha/Butterscotch/releases/latest) and run it. Pick the game's `data.win` (for 1.5.5: the one in the
   launcher's `Profiles/Community Updates (Latest)` folder, with its music files next to it) and a folder; it writes
   `<folder>/3ds/am2r/`, which you copy to the root of the SD card, and downloads `am2r.cia` next to it.
   - On Windows it runs in WSL, and offers to install WSL (administrator rights and a restart) if it isn't there.
   - The first run downloads the tools it needs (the preprocessor and devkitPro's `tex3ds`) into its own folder.
   - Developers can also run `tools/n3ds/make_sd.sh <game folder> <out>` from a checkout (needs devkitPro).

   The folder only needs rebuilding when a release says it needs a newer SD data revision; the game tells you at
   startup if the card's folder is out of date.

2. **The program.** Open the [latest release](https://github.com/pegacha/Butterscotch/releases/latest) and scan its QR code with FBI
   (Remote Install → Scan QR Code), or download `am2r.cia` and install it with FBI from the SD card.
   Every passing build is published as a release; builds from branches other than `main` are marked pre-release
   (`claude/*` work-in-progress branches only get a build artifact).

Saves, `cheats.ini` (the 3DS options) and `log.txt` go in `sdmc:/3ds/am2r/`.

## Playing

- **Buttons:** B jump, Y fire, A morph, L/ZL aim, R missiles, ZR aim lock, Select weapon, Start pause; in menus A is OK
  and B is back. The full layout is in [res/n3ds/am2r/README.md](../res/n3ds/am2r/README.md); the game's own Joypad menu
  can rebind it.
- **Bottom screen:** the area map around Samus while you play; a tap opens the pause screen there, which is driven by
  touch (pages, map panning and markers, inventory, logs, options).
- **Options → Display** is a 3DS page:
  - *Screen:* Stretch (default), 1x, 2x or Wide.
  - *Frameskip:* a steady 30 fps at full game speed.
  - *Fast scripts:* on by default. Runs the game's busiest scripts (HUD, minimap, collision checks, the Area 6 light
    map, ...) as built-in code: same result, much faster. "N/A" for game versions it wasn't written for.
  - *Cheats:* unlimited health and ammo, stronger weapons.
- **Start+Select** shows a performance monitor.

## Performance

Measured in the Azahar emulator at CPU clock 100 (close to a real New 3DS) with the 1.5.5 game files, release build.
Most rooms run at the full 60 fps; the busiest ones need 12–15 ms of the 16.7 ms frame budget.

| room | before (2026-10-06) | now |
|---|---|---|
| `rm_a3h04` (730 objects) | 28 fps | 51 fps |
| `rm_a6b14` (Area 6, light map) | 29 fps | 49 fps |
| `rm_a5h04` (lava) | 26 fps | 51 fps |
| `rm_a2h02` | 47 fps | 52 fps |

(Each figure includes a screenshot stall in the test; real hardware numbers welcome, via `log.txt`.)

## Building

```bash
tools/n3ds/build.sh ../build-n3ds    # -> am2r.cia + am2r.3dsx (needs devkitARM, and makerom for the .cia)
```

[.github/workflows/build-n3ds.yml](workflows/build-n3ds.yml) is the reference build: the `devkitpro/devkitarm`
container, with makerom built from [3DSGuy/Project_CTR](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR).

[PORTING_NOTES.md](../PORTING_NOTES.md) covers how the port works: the SD layout, the emulator test loop (Azahar) and its
harness, the renderer, audio and file system, the pause screen, the built-in scripts, profiling, performance work and
known issues.
