// AM2R scripts and events rewritten in C ("Fast scripts" on the Display page): the ones that cost the most per frame in
// the interpreter. Each replaces the game's code only when that code's bytecode is exactly the version it was written
// from (AM2R 1.5.5, the Community Updates); anything else keeps running the game's own code. A native gives the game's
// code back (calls it) whenever it meets something it doesn't expect (a variable missing or of another type).
